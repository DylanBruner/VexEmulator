Brain
 - Current Devices that can be emulated
   - Bumper
   - Controller
   - Distance Sensor
   - Drivetrain
   - Gyroscope
   - Electro Magnet
   - Motor
   - Optical Sensor (not tested)
   - Rotation Sensor

 - What happens when a program is executed/selected/clicked
  1. The program is loaded into a "CodeContainer"
    - A CodeContainer is a container for a program it has it's own functions, variables, globals, etc.
  2. All of the devices are loaded into the CodeContainers globals
                (Supported Devices that are in the .v5python config file)
  3. The CodeContainer is executed on it's own thread
     - It can fully access the brain's screen/timer/battery/etc.

 - Has a device info screen like the real brain but it doesn't do anything at the moment
   as the devices are not loaded until a program is executed.

 - It is possible to progomaticly check wether or not the code is running on Physical or Emulated brain by checking if
   any of the devices have the attribute ._attributes for example 
   hasattr(device, "_attributes")

 - 18 diffrent programs can be ran from the brain, 3 from the home screen and 15 from the user programs screen
 - The User Programs Folder works as mentioned above
 - Loads programs as .v5python
 - Uses a "virtual" SD Card that the programs can write to as normal
  - /data/emulatedstorage/SDCard
 - All programs are stored in data/emulatedstorage/Internal/Programs
 - Home button allows exiting a program and returning to the home screen where another program can be ran
 - Emulates/Redirects functions like Thread, wait to their respective external libraries

 - Planned Features
  - If the code fails show a popup asking if the user wants to retry in legacy mode
  - Legacy mode
    - Add support for functions VEX changed or removed
  - Make all devices able to be emulated
  - Maybe use physical controller on the emulated brain not sure about the practicality of this
  - Register the brain's battery as a emulated device that way the web UI can control it's attributes


Webserver
 - Allows all devices and their attributes to be modified through the browser
 - Current supported attribute types
  - Boolean
  - String
  - Integer
  - Float

 - Planned Features
  - Make the UI look a lot nicer (pictures!!)
  - Use sliders when possible
  - Make device attributes collapseable
  - Group / order devices by type
    - Controller is at top when loaded
  - Nicer Input themeing
