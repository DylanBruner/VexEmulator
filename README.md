<h1>VEX v5 Brain Emulator</h1>
<br>
<h2>What it is and isn't</h2>
 - It's not, a virtual machine that can run C++ programs
    - It is, a pygame powered interface that's capable of running VEX v5python programs

 - It's not, (at least not yet) a full simulation, the devices dont talk to each other to figure out location data and such
    - It is, a way to test programs without a brain, the web interface can be used to simulate the devices actually being there

 - It's not, a professional grade emulator
    - It is, a hobby project, I've created this as a side project so bugs are to be expected

 - It's not, a seemless replacment for a physical brain
    - It is, a emulator that supports most devices (eventually will support all)
